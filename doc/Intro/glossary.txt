   The official CGNS web site, by extension any document on this web
   site has an *official* taste...

 CGNS 
   The specific purpose of the 
   `CFD General Notation System (CGNS) <http://www.cgns.org>`_
   project is to provide a standard for recording and recovering
   computer data associated with the numerical solution of the
   equations of fluid dynamics. See also the 
   :ref:`How to? <topix:cgnshowto>`.

 CGNS/SIDS 
   The `Standard Interface Data Structure <http://cgns.github.io/CGNS_docs_current/sids/index.html>`_ is the
   specification of the data model.  This public document describes
   the syntax and the semantics of all tree-structured data required
   or proposed for a CFD simulation.

 CGNS/MLL 
   The `Mid-Level Library <http://cgns.github.io/CGNS_docs_current/midlevel/index.html>`_ 
   is an example implementation of
   *CGNS/SIDS* on top of *CGNS/ADF* and *CGNS/HDF5* mappings. This
   library has a C and a Fortran API.

 CGNS/ADF
   The `Advanced Data Format *CGNS/SIDS* implementation <http://cgns.github.io/CGNS_docs_current/adf/index.html>`_. A binary
   storage format and its companion library, developped by *Boeing*.

 CGNS/HDF5
   The `Hierarchical Data Format *CGNS/SIDS* implementation <http://cgns.github.io/CGNS_docs_current/hdf5/index.html>`_. A binary
   storage format and its companion library (see below).

 CGNS/Python
   The `Python programming language *CGNS/SIDS* 
   implementation <http://cgns.github.io/CGNS_docs_current/python/index.html>`_. 

 CHLone 
   A *CGNS/HDF5* compliant implementation. The `CHLone
   <http://chlone.sourceforge.net>`_ library is available on
   SourceForge.

 HDF5
   A powerful storage system for large data. 
   The `HDF5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5>`_
   library should be seen as a middleware system with a lot of powerful
   features related to efficient, portable and trustable storage mean.

 python
   `An object oriented interpreted programming language <http://www.python.org>`_. 

 cython
   A `compiler tool <http://cython.org>`_ that translate Python/Numpy 
   into C code for performance purpose.

 numpy
   The `numerical library <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ for Python. *Numpy*
   is used to store the data in Python arrays which have a direct memory
   mapping to actual C or Fortran memory.

 VTK 
   A `visualization toolkit <http://www.vtk.org>`_ used to display
   3D objects in *CGNS.NAV*.

 PySide
   The `Python interface <http://www.pyside.org>`_ for the Qt toolkit. PySide

 Qt
   `A powerful graphical toolkit <http://www.qt.io/download>`_ available 
   under GPL v3, LGPL v2 and a commercial license. The current use of Qt is 
   under LGPL v2 in pyCGNS.
